# CMS Website Project
This project is a content management system (CMS) website built using:

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>SQL</li>
</ul>

The website allows users to create, update, delete, and view articles, providing a foundational experience in CMS functionality. For this specific task, I developed a streamlined version inspired by the "Welt" website, focusing on essential content management features and user experience.
